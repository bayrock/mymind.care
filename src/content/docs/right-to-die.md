The right to die is a concept rooted in the belief that individuals have the autonomy to make fundamental decisions about their own lives, *including the choice to end them or undergo voluntary euthanasia*, central to the broader notion of health freedom.

This right is often associated with cases involving terminal illnesses or incurable pain, where assisted suicide provides an option for individuals to exercise control over their suffering and dignity.
