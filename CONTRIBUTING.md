## ✍️ Sign-Off Required for Contributions

To help maintain clear authorship and accountability, **all contributors must “sign off” on their commits** — especially when using GitHub’s web interface.

This is a simple statement that says:  
> *“I wrote this code or have the right to submit it under the project’s license.”*

By submitting a pull request or committing to this project, you confirm that you have the legal right to contribute the code and that it complies with our licensing terms.

### ✅ How to Sign Off

You can do this automatically when committing from the command line:

```bash
git commit -s -m "(your commit message)"
```
This adds a line at the bottom of your commit like:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
_If you use the GitHub web interface (like editing a file online), please **manually add** this line to your commit message before submitting._
